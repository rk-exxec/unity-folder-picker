# unity-folder-picker
A UI Toolkit Object Field that allows you to specify a path to show only the assets in that directory in the Object Picker.

Requires Unity's UI Toolkit.
## Installation

Simply add all files under the Assets/Editor folder to your project's Editor folder.  
The Script `FolderPickerDemo.cs` is an example of how to use the FolderPicker.
It needs a reference to the ObjectPickerFolder.uxml file to open the UI.
Add it by clicking the script and then selecting the uxml file as the `Main UI Template`

You can also just clone the repo and open the project in Unity.

## Usage

In the toolbar click Tools -> FolderPickerDemo to open the demo EditorWindow.
Open the picker dialog with the edit button to the right of the object field.
